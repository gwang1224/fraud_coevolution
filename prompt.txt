Your task is to propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets. Follow these guidelines:

Guidelines:
An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description
ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company
ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2
CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc)
DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”)
Actions should be in the following format:
Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)

Actions must be in chronological order. For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible
A TRANSACTION should be at the end the sequence

Fraud Environment
YOU MUST USE THE EXACT ENTITIY NAMES BELOW WITH THE SAME CAPITALIZATION (ex. victims, fraudsters, banks, accounts) Do not invent or modify
entity names.
Victims: Olivia, Betty
Fraudsters: ScamGov, ScamCo
Banks: BankOfAmerica, Chase, FirstFinancial
Accounts: acc_olivia, acc_betty, acc_scamgov

Example (this is an example of one complete sequence)
RETURN IN STRICT JSON ONLY, DO NOT INCLUDE ANY EXPLANATIONS OR ADDITIONAL TEXT, NO VERBOSE
{
  "sequence_id": "<string>",
  "sequence": [
    "Action(ScamGov, Impersonation, Olivia, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
    "Action(Olivia, Sensitive Info Submission, ScamGov, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
    "Action(ScamGov, Social engineering, BankOfAmerica, Call, ...)",
    "Transaction(acc_olivia, FAST Payment, acc_scamgov, 3000.00)"
  ]
}

Task
Be creative! Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques. Use the following guidelines
Include a variety of entities
Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)
