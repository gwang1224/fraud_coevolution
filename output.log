        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",

            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.

        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE

            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.


        EXAMPLE
        (This is an example of ONE complete sequence)
        Take inspiration from this, do NOT copy it, be original
        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(<entity1>, Impersonation, <entity2>, Call, Posed as IRS agent)",
            "action(<entity2>, Sensitive Info Submission, <entity1>, SMS, sent SSN + DOB)",
            "action(<entity1>, Social engineering, <bank1>, Call, ...)",
            "transaction(<entity2 bank account>, FAST Payment, <entity1 bank account>, 3000.00)"
        ]
        }

        Return a **single JSON dictionary** with the following structure, no verbose:

        {
        "sequence": [
            "action(...)", 
            ...
            "transaction(...)"
        ]
        }

        Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the raw JSON dictionary.


        TASK
        - Be creative!
        - The entities should tell a story.
        - Choose diverse entities, action/transaction combinations and unique fraud techniques.
        - Use the following guidelines.
        - Include a variety of entities.
        - Experiment with different types of fraud (Identity theft, account takeover, SIM swap, but you are NOT limited to these!)

        - Do NOT include:
        - Explanations, comments, or notes.
        - Extra fields in Action or Transaction.
        - Non-matching entity names (use only names in the environment list).

        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.

        YOUR TASK
        - Propose 1 valid action/transaction sequence within a network of entities and assets.
        - Follow these guidelines:


        GUIDELINES
        - An action must involve two entities (ENTITY1 and ENTITY2), action, channel, description.
        - ENTITY1 and ENTITY2 can be an individual or company.
        - ACTION is the action taken by ENTITY1 upon ENTITY2.
        - CHANNEL is the fraud mode (SMS, email, phone, etc).
        - DESCRIPTION is a detailed description of what action occurred (ex. for “impersonation” action, a potential description is “Posed as IRS agent”).
        - An Action must have **exactly five comma-separated fields** inside the parentheses:
        Action(ENTITY1, ACTION, ENTITY2, CHANNEL, DESCRIPTION)
        - A Transaction must have exactly four comma-separated fields:
        Transaction(ACCOUNT_FROM, FAST Payment, ACCOUNT_TO, AMOUNT)
        - Actions must be in chronological order.
        - For sequential actions, ENTITY2 in the first action should become ENTITY1 in the second action.
        - Money can only be fraudulently transferred if the account is compromised.
        - A fraudster can only transfer money into their bank account, however, once a victim’s account is compromised, a fraudster can transfer money from the victim’s account.
        - FAST transfers are instantaneous and irreversible.
        - A TRANSACTION should be at the end of the sequence.

        FRAUD ENVIRONMENT
        - You must use the exact entity names. Do not invent or modify entity names.

        - You may use:

        - sally, grace, bill as entities for victims.

        - govco, insuranceco, insurancenet as entities for fraudsters.

        - bankofamerica, chase, firstfinancial as entities for banks.

        - acc_sally, acc_grace, acc_bill, acc_conedison, acc_tmobile, acc_govco, acc_insuranceco as entities for accounts.
